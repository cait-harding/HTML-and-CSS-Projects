<p>Here is my practice blockquote, which talks about Eddie Munson:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://screenrant.com/stranger-things-eddies-best-quotes/">
With a ringmaster's sense of the theatrical and a heart of gold buried under his denim jacket, Eddie Munson is the scene-stealing new character of Stranger Things, responsible for some of the best dialogue season 4 has to offer. The dungeon master of the Hellfire Club presents as a possible Hawkins high school bully in Vol. 1's first episode, but a run-in with Vecna soon makes him an ally to the Scoop Troop and the rest of the Hawkins kids.
